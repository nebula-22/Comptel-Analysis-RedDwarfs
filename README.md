# Comptel-Analysis-RedDwarfs
This repository contains all the spectrum files generated during COMPTEL data analysis by using the ctools software. These fits files help us create the Spectral Energy Distributions(SED) using the show_spectrum script and also find out the Differential Photon Flux And Intrgral energy flux from the red dwarfs.

In case of any queries, please contact niharikas21@iiserb.ac.in.
